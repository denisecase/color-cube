> 3D Color Cube for MandArt

## MandArt Coloring

MandArt is a digital art form that uses the Mandelbrot Set to create unique artwork.
The colors you choose will be blended using a color gradient between each two adjacent colors.
These intermediate colors will appear in your MandArt.

If you pick any two adjacent colors that could be connected by a line that goes through the center of the cube,
you're likely to get gray in the color gradient, which might not make the best color for your art.

## Selecting Colors in MandArt

When creating in MandArt, you select colors using a MandArt color picker.
The color picker has an eye dropper tool that lets you select any color showing on your screen.

## Using the Color Cube

This color cube is a tool to help you select colors for your MandArt.
By viewing this cube, you can see the colors that will be blended between two colors you select.
Choose a good path between adjacent colors that pass through colors you'd like to see in your MandArt.
