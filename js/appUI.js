/**
 * Main module for initializing and managing a 3D environment using Three.js.
 *
 * This module serves as the core of a 3D application, handling the setup and
 * maintenance of various components essential for rendering a 3D scene. It imports
 * and utilizes Three.js for creating and manipulating 3D graphics.
 *
 * Key functionalities include:
 *  - Initializing the 3D scene, camera, and renderer.
 *  - Setting up and managing a group of cubes in the scene.
 *  - Handling dynamic animations for the cubes, including gap changes and rotation.
 *  - Adjusting the scene's rendering based on browser window resize events.
 *
 * External modules are imported for specific aspects of the scene setup and management:
 *  - 'resize.js' for handling window resize events.
 *  - 'settings_camera.js', 'settings_gap.js', 'settings_rotate.js' for various configuration settings.
 *  - 'ui_cube.js', 'ui_gap.js', 'ui_rotate.js' for UI-related functionalities and animations.
 *
 * This module exports key components like the scene, camera, and renderer, along with
 * the initialization function and utility functions for the 3D environment.
 *
 * It is imported and used in app.js, cubeUI.js, gapUI.js, rotateUI.js, and app.js.

 * Sets up the camera for the 3D scene.
 *
 * The camera is a THREE.PerspectiveCamera, which simulates the way the human eye sees.
 * It is characterized by four main properties:
 *
 * 1. Field of View (FOV): e.g., 50-75
 *    - Represents the extent of the observable world seen at any moment (in degrees).
 *    - A larger FOV value results in a wider perspective, while a smaller FOV narrows the view.
 *
 * 2. Aspect Ratio: window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight
 *    - The ratio of the width to the height of the camera's viewport.
 *    - Using the window's width and height ensures the camera's aspect ratio matches the display's.
 *
 * 3. Near Clipping Plane: e.g., 0.1
 *    - The closest distance to the camera at which objects will be rendered.
 *    - Objects closer to the camera than this distance will not be visible.
 *
 * 4. Far Clipping Plane: e.g., 100-1000
 *    - The farthest distance from the camera at which objects will be rendered.
 *    - Objects beyond this distance from the camera will not be visible.
 *
 * After setting up these properties, the camera's position is set to around (0, -10, 0),
 * and it is oriented to look at the center of the scene.
